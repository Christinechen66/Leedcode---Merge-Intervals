# Leedcode Question---Merge-Intervals

Given a list of integer intervals defined by (start, end), where start is inclusive and end is exclusive, write a function that returns the sum of the integers in the union of all the intervals. 

For example, given:  intervals = [ (1, 5), (3, 7), (10, 12), ] We can see that the union of all intervals would be [1, 7) + [10, 12), which results in a return value of 42 (1+2+3+4+5+6+10+11).  In solving this problem, document the function and demonstrate that it works for all edge cases.
